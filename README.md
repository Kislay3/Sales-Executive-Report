- Omprakash O shows the highest "Away From Target %" at 71.40%, indicating significant room for improvement in meeting targets.
- Despite moderate sales figures, executives like Dinesh Kumar and Praveen Kumar are still 66.8% away from targets, implying overestimated targets or performance issues.
- The pie chart representation of target hit distribution is evenly split (each at 20%), suggesting a fairly balanced performance among the core group of executives.
